## Recap

### I Have Learnt:

- [#1](https://vincentp.me/articles/2019/06/19/21-00/)
    - I need to make what I build adaptive. Do not assume one type of content will be utilised more than another because that is what I do right now.
    - The design is not doing the heavy lifting I require from it.
    - While I have the overall trajectory in the right direction, the website needs fine tuning in all areas.
- [#2](https://vincentp.me/articles/2019/06/30/11-00/)
    - I am happy in general with the technical way the static website works.
    - I need to re-examine the technology it is built upon, [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) looks to be the favoured platform to switch.
    - Build time needs to be reduced it is creeping up and taking too long.
    - I have some custom areas of my Jekyll build that need to be documented and ascertained if I can get feature parity by it's replacement.

### Future Actions

- [#1](https://vincentp.me/articles/2019/06/19/21-00/)
    - Do a deep dive on the UX.
    - Look in to the user interface design at a later date, once I understand requirements better.
    - I have yet to review where Mastr Cntrl is not meeting my requirements.
    - I have not looked at the overall architecture and this needs reviewing.
- [#2](https://vincentp.me/articles/2019/06/30/11-00/)
    - Explore [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/) and build a POC to demonstrate I can migrate successfully.
    - Revisit the design and UX of the current site. Explore this in detail to design a system that works for my needs.
    - Investigate improving the quality of my RSS feeds and general syndication content.
    - Investigate Avatar loading, caching and progressive loading techniques.
    - Minimise external load content such as Mapbox images and Avatars.
    - Set some time to review my Netlify integration and set-up. How can this be improved?
    - Set some time to review future integrations and what I will be accommodating.
    - Automate syndicating to IndieNews.
