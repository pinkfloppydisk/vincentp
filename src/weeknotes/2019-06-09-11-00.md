## The blog

Much of my free time this week has been spent thinking and planning the forthcoming redesign project. I have a post nearly ready to go detailing it all and I can't wait to share it :-)

## Holiday

It was the Queen's birthday celebrations in New Zealand on Monday so we got an extra day off work. Given the day we decided to explore the Queen Elizabeth Park and Paekakariki  Beach. The beach (as always) was spectacular and mostly deserted with great views over to Kapiti Island *and* the South island. It blew our mind you could see so far. We could even see the snow on the south island mountains, amazing!

## Renting

The renting saga continued on this week, the owners of the  property we want to rent long term are having visa issues with the country they are moving to. Fingers crossed they can get it sorted. After finally finding somewhere we could call home for a while it would be a real pain to have to start all over again.
