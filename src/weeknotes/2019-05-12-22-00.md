It seems, despite writing this a few days ago. I forgot to upload it. Whoops sorry!

This week my day job has been demanding a lot of me, and my evenings have been filled with "admin" closing down my company. But I managed to find time to close off a few long standing bugs on the website. Hurray!

As I move towards closing the final bugs down it feels like a good time to take stock of the blog and how integrating various IndieWeb functions are hanging together..

It's fair to say that I'm not currently happy with the balance of the content. Checkins and what I call "passive" content are dominating the space too much and some of the architecture I threw together in a hurry to try things out is poorly coded. So I've been toying with the idea of re-designing the website, but blogging through my process as I go.

It could be fun to document my process for others, but I'm concerned this would be a long project. Still mulling it over.
