## Birthday

Seb turned 5 last week, so I took a break last week from weeknotes for family time.

Cat made Seb a giant 5 racetrack cake which went down very well!

For Seb's birthday we took him Go-Karting and 10-pin bowling.  Go Karting was a lot of fun Seb managed about 5-10 minutes on his own before he decided to hop in the two-seater with his mum. Not bad for his first effort!

Unfortunately when it came to the bowling I have to hang my head in shame, Seb managed to get a strike and a bunch of spares near the end and won!

Afterwards we went to [Giuseppes](https://www.giuseppes.co.nz/) in Lower Hutt for some amazing Italian pizzas and gelato.

Great day!

## Redesign

Work is slowly progressing on the redesign. My day job is consuming a lot of my time at the moment and the next post in the series is pretty weighty. In a week or so, I should have the time to get back on to it and get things moving.
