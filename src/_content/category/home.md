hello


During my career I have been incredibly fortunate to work on a diverse range of products and services :

- Enterprise healthcare applications
- [Government Services](https://gov.uk)
- Worldwide marketing campaigns
- Virtual reality
- Sites for major brands and start-ups.
- Medical systems, doctors systems and UK wide medical systems applications.
- A global social media platform
- Computer games

I love a challenge or complex problems to solve. Tailoring solutions specifically to your business needs and skill levels. An expert at breaking down complex problems, explaining them in simple language. I can help you get to the root of a problem and communicate with all parts of your business what is happening.
