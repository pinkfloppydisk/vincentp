Prefixes when using Microformats

I had always wondered what the p- and u- prefixes meant when using Microformats. Thanks to the Indieweb slack channel I got the answer while querying about u-category and p-category today.

Semantically nothing is different. The prefix is a parser directive. u- (URL) tells it to take the value for category from a href attribute, src attribute, etc. While p- (plain text) tells it to take the value from the element's inner-text, or sometimes title attribute (e.g. for abbr elements).

Making a note of this here in case I forget.
