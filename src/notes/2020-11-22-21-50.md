Had an hour tonight to add in some "quality of life" code, auto-tagging links and Twitter handle links.

It has irked me for a while that when using a Micropub client I couldn't link these up as easily as manually writing the file.

[My code is here](https://github.com/vipickering/vincentp/blob/main/lib/parsers/markdown/markdown.js) which you can copy wholesale if you are running Eleventy, just make sure you set the linkify option to true (as well as the code below) or it won't work.
