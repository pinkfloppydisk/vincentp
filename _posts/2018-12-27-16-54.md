## Personal

I've spent much of 2018 making preparations to move my family to New Zealand. My wife and I fell in love with NZ a long time ago and have dreamt of moving for some time. In February we spent a month touring both islands (with a short stop in Singapore). This trip wholeheartedly cemented our desire to move and we resolved to make it happen.

Almost a year later (April 2019) and if all goes to plan, we will have left our old life behind in the UK to begin anew in the friendliest, prettiest place on this earth and I can't wait.

## Projects

There is a lot happening in my life but I am still resolving to finish my IndieWeb implementation and port the site to Eleventy by the end of 2019. If I find some spare hours in the day, I'll turn Mastr Cntrl in to Lambda functions too!

## Professional Work

I will no longer be accepting new contracts in 2019. Running my current contract until it expires before we leave for NZ and my new full time job. If you were hoping I could provide assistance and support to your business in 2019 there are [some](https://northerncontrast.com/){:rel="external"} [great](https://flodesign.co.uk/){:rel="external"} [people](https://csswizardry.com/){:rel="external"} I  can recommend who offer similar services. Look them up :-)

2019 is going to be bloody brilliant.
