Yesterday I spoke at [Forefront Leeds](https://forefront.cc/forefront-no1-18th-november-2013/){:rel="external"} a recent speaking event for frontend developers in the Leeds area, run by Russell Poulter of [Flodesign](https://flodesign.co.uk){:rel="external"}.

Russ chose a great place for the venue. [The Brewery Taps](https://www.brewerytapleeds.co.uk){:rel="external"}, which is only a short walk from the station.

There was really flexible format to the event, 3 speakers each has a maximum of 15 minutes to talk about anything frontend related, then some beers and socialising. It’s a format I found worked really well on the night and I met quite a few new people, I also found the talks were a great way for people who might be a little nervous to feel they could approach you and strike up a conversation, based around what you have just heard.

I spoke first on Structured Data, 15 minutes isn’t a huge amount of time to teach people too much so I concentrated on spending the time introducing people to the ideas around Structured Data, it’s concepts and the technologies involved, hopefully I gave some of the attendees a starting point for them to grow their understand and confidence in using Structured Data in the future.

[Here are my slides if your interested](https://speakerdeck.com/vincentp/a-brief-overview-on-structured-data){:rel="external"}

Next up was [Andy Fitch](https://twitter.com/_andyfitch){:rel="external"} of [Parallax](https://parall.ax){:rel="external"} who gave a talk about the processes they use internally at Parallax. It always interesting to hear how others work and Andy did a great job explaining it all.

To close the talks, [Paul Stanton](https://twitter.com/stanton){:rel="external"}gave a great introduction to [Bower](https://bower.io){:rel="external"} Twitters automated package manager, which is a fantastic piece of software.

It was a great opening event, and a fantastic start to something I hope will go on for quite some time.
